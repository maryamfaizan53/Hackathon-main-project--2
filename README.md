Hackathon Project: E-Commerce Website with Dynamic Routing
Purpose of the Project
This repository contains the implementation of a dynamic e-commerce website created during the hackathon organized under the guidance of Sir Ameen Alam.

Each product has its own dynamically generated page.
Easy navigation between product pages and categories.
UI/UX Implementation:

Built based on the provided Figma design to ensure pixel-perfect UI.
Utilized Tailwind CSS for responsive and consistent styling.
Next.js Framework:

Server-side rendering and static generation for optimal performance.
Component-based architecture for modular and reusable code.
E-Commerce Focused:

Product listing pages with detailed product descriptions.
Enhanced navigation for an intuitive shopping experience.
